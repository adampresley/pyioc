# PyIOC

A simple Python IOC framework. This is a stupid-simple IOC (Inversion of Control) framework.
At this time it *only* does object injection by inserting a method called **inject()**
into your objects that is used to create your dependent object variables.

As an example we have a service named **ExampleService**.

```python
class ExampleService():
	def saveInfo(self, id, newDate):
		self.exampleWebServiceFacade.save(id=id, dateModified=self.dateService.toUTC(newDate))
```

```python
import pyioc

pyioc.configure(
	paths=("../model",),
	config={
		"ExampleService": {
			"dependencies": [
				"DateService",
				"ExampleWebServiceFacade"
			]
		},
		"DateService": {},
		"ExampleWebServiceFacade": {
			"dependencies": [
				"DateService"
			]
		}
	}
)

service = pyioc.getBean("ExampleService")
service.saveInfo(1, datetime.now)
```

The above example shows a service object that references a web service facade object
and a date service object. These are injected into the **ExampleService** object
by PyIOC when you call **getBean()**.
